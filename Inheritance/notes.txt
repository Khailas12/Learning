Single Inheritance
Multiple Inheritance
Multilevel Inheritance
Hierarchical Inheritance
Hybrid Inheritance


Hierarchial Inheritance
when more than one derived classes are created from a single base. in other words when more than one class inherits from a class.

Hybrid inheritance
This form combines more than one form of inheritance. Basically, it is a blend of more than one type of inheritance.
